## Q: Is it production-ready?

Congratulations on discovering Nextpy before its beta launch! üß≠ While it's stable and we're rigorously testing it in our own production, we recommend a cautious approach for immediate production use. Be aware of its unique quirks and minor bugs, currently on our 'Array of Minor Annoyances' list.

**Ready to Dive In?**

Ahoy, adventurer! üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è We're thrilled to have you aboard. Let's create something extraordinary together! ‚ú®

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To install, open a terminal and run (Python 3.7 or higher required):

```bash
pip install nextpy
```

## üöÄ Quickstart (5 mins)

Kickstart your first Nextpy app with this easy guide. We'll guide you through the essential steps to get a Nextpy app running quickly.

For a more in-depth project, explore our app examples.

### Setting Up

1. **Create a New Directory:**
   Open a terminal and create a new directory for your app:

   ```bash
   mkdir myapp
   ```

2. **Navigate to Your Directory:**
   Switch to your newly created directory:

   ```bash
   cd myapp
   ```

3. **Initialize Your App:**
   Start your app with this command:
   ```bash
   nextpy init
   ```
   Choose from:
   - **Blank Template:** For a fresh start.
   - **Base Template:** For a pre-setup experience.

### Running Your App

1. **Start the App:**
   Inside your app's directory, run:

   ```bash
   nextpy run
   ```

2. **View the App:**
   Check out your app by visiting [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser.

### Building a Joke Generator App

Edit `myapp/myapp.py` to create your app.

#### Import Libraries

```python
import nextpy as xt
import pyjokes
```

Start by importing `nextpy` for development and `pyjokes` for random jokes.

#### Set Up the App State

```python
class State(xt.State):
    joke: str = "Click the button to get a joke!"

    def generate_joke(self):
        self.joke = pyjokes.get_joke()
```

Create a `State` class with a `joke` variable. Use `generate_joke` to fetch new jokes.

#### Design the Main Page

```python
def index():
    return xt.vstack(
        xt.text(State.joke, font_size="2em"),
        xt.button(
            "Generate Joke",
            on_click=State.generate_joke,
        ),
        spacing="1em",
        align_items="center",
        justify_content="center",
        height="100vh",
    )
```

The `index` function arranges a joke display and a button, centered on the screen.

#### Build and Run the App

```python
app = xt.App()
app.add_page(index)
app.compile()
```

Set up the app, add the main page, and prepare it for launch.

Your app, completed in under 25 lines, will be accessible at `localhost:3000` with the server running on `localhost:8000`.
